# Developer quiz

## Notes

The backend is a simple REST API written using Express.js. It has endpoints to retrieve all questions as well as the answer for a specific question. No database is used.

The frontend is written with React and Redux. Tests are written for reducers, selectors and async action creators. One example test is written for the Result component.

## Scripts

* `npm install` - installs the required packages.
* `npm run build` - builds the app for production.
* `npm run server` - runs the backend server at port 3008.
* `npm start` - runs the app in development mode at port 3007.
* `npm test` - launches the test runner.
